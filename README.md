## 🛠️ **Development**

### **Prerequisites**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Additional Crops (Future)**
The platform is designed for easy expansion. To add more crops:

1. **Create crop directory**: `india_agri_platform/crops/{crop_name}/`
2. **Add model trainer**: `scripts/{crop_name}_model_trainer.py`
3. **Update config**: Add to `platform.yaml` supported_crops
4. **Train models**: Run trainer and place in `models/advanced_models/`

### **Model Training Process**
```bash
# Train individual crop models
python rice_model_trainer.py
python cotton_model_trainer.py
python maize_model_trainer.py

# Models saved to: models/advanced_models/
```
